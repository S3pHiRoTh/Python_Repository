*This python repository was initially created to hone my programming skills in python by doing around 100 set exercises to do (http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/); I also was inspired by https://github.com/karan github user who is doing the same thing to hone is python skills too.
