About
------------------
This python repository was initially created to hone my programming skills in python by doing around 100 set exercises to do (http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/; I also was inspired by this github user who is doing the same thing
to hone is python skills too. His github page is located here : https://github.com/karan/Projects. Thanks Karan for the idea!
